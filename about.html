                        <p>We are a grassroots organisation dedicated to amplifying the voices of ethnic minorities in South Devon through education, creative projects, workshops and events.</p>
                        <p>Please get in touch with us if you would like to join our efforts, or have recommendations for what we can help to highlight and work on. </p>

                                <p>Racism in the UK is both a very serious issue and a dangerous one. With Devon being a predominantly white area (94.9% white, with Torbay being 97.5% white – 2011 census), it is difficult to see the workings of oppression when it is not experienced first-hand. Not experiencing it yourself, however, does not mean that it doesn’t happen to the other people who do live here, or to the rapidly decreasing number of tourists who visit every year. In fact, for those who do live here, it often becomes a case of tolerating what happens to and around them in order to be accepted and fit in. Black people, people of colour and ethnic minorities shouldn’t have to accept the regular covert – and increasingly overt – racism just in order to get by. We are living in 2020, but South Devon seems to be decades behind.</p>

                            <div class="media-body">
                                <p>At SDARA, we are acutely aware of the threat caused by unaddressed racism. Papering over the cracks was never sufficient. Our system needs to change. We need to change. As a community-led organisation, we aim to open the eyes of those who believe this is a non-existent issue in South Devon, exposing the mechanics of racism and imploring residents to become actively anti-racist.

                                <p>By creating a platform, we will amplify the voices of those who are underrepresented, holding space for Black people and POC (people of colour) to be heard, seen and valued. In order to do this we will take a creative route, ultimately laying the foundations for a deeper understanding of these issues. Art is experiential; it goes beyond words, allowing the artist to express their experience in their own unique way, and the audience to interpret information in a manner they had not done previously, to think, “I hadn’t seen it that way before”.

                                <p>When discussing issues of racism, there is often a bombardment of terminologies and statistics, which can be overwhelming. But these words and numbers overshadow the voices of real people, putting minorities into categories and checkboxes without considering their point of view or celebrating their successes. With these heavy barriers up, it is difficult to engage with information that is contrary to one’s pre-existing biases. It blocks our human instinct: empathy.</p>

                                <p>In small towns, these slowly evolving mentalities are both the result and the cause of deteriorating town centres, lack of opportunity for young people, and years of unchallenged discriminatory beliefs: all of which offer fertile ground for racially targeted anti-social behaviour and hate crimes. Through active engagement with public-facing creative projects – something that South Devon undeniably lacks – we are hoping that people will grow more receptive to information that their education systems and stagnant surroundings do not offer.</p>

                                <p>We are a member-run grassroots organisation. As an ever-evolving and growing community collective, we hope to transform the secluded sphere that is South Devon; not only for the people who currently live there, but for anyone who visits and the generations of the future. We run on a voluntary basis, outsourcing skills and time from passionate members of our community. However, all of our projects hope to be fully funded in order to continue our support for the South Devon creatives that this platform is for, offering financial support for their creative and educational work.</p>

                                <p>What we will offer are mainly projects, resources, and networks. We want to empower Black people and POC in South Devon, offering a safe space in which to express themselves, and a platform which they can use to reach out and engage with more people. We will offer workshops, educational events, and other group activities – in person or online – in order to get conversations started and develop an understanding around these complex issues. We will form connections with other local organisations, schools, and businesses, in order to raise awareness more effectively and with a larger outreach. We will encourage a more progressive use of language and help bring about a tangible decrease in hate crimes. We will offer young people in the area a means through which they can understand how racism impacts their lives, particularly focussing on those who have also been neglected by the system. We will make people aware that racism is a very present UK issue, and that South Devon holds its own heavy responsibility.</p>
